## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

**One point that stood out to me was operating within the Zone of Proximal Development.  Due to my competitive nature, I often compare myself to those around me.  It is critical for me to focus on my improvement within my ZPD because making small, incremental improvements in my own zone will lead to greater improvements within my abilities as a whole.**

**Another point that stood out to me was not being afraid to ask for help.  This is a common theme with me since I am the type that likes to truck through issues and takes pleasure in solving them on my own. Again, it is critical I focus on reaching out for assistance when I am struggling with an issue.**


2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
**I believe I show a Growth Mindset in my decision to go back to school to learn coding.  I value education and learning and throughout my life, I have continuously sought opportunities to grow and acquire new skills.  I switched from teaching high school to working as IT support because I wanted to get my foot in the door in the tech world.**

**I have limited myself to one employer and one geographic area which has kept my mindset fixed in terms of the work environment and culture I experienced.  I hope that by learning new technology skills, I am able to find another employer and culture to work within so that I continue to learn and grow outside of my past experiences.**


3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
**A conditional statement checks whether a given condition is true or false and takes action if the condition is met (true).**

**Example 1**
```ruby
if pandas == 30
  puts "There are lots of pandas here."
else
  puts "Need more pandas"
end
```
**Example 2**
```ruby
if temperature >= 60
  puts "It's too warm outside"
elsif temperature <= 15
  puts "It's too cold outside"
else
  puts "I'm staying inside"
end
```

**Example 3**
```ruby
if fatigue == true && caffeine_level = "low"
  puts "Coffee Time!"
  energy +=10
elsif fatigue == false && caffeine_level = "low"
  puts "No coffee today!"
elsif fatigue == true && caffeine_level = "high"
  puts "Red bull it is."
else
  puts "I love coffee"
end
```


4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
**You could use an if-statement to evaluate whether a condition is true and have an action or set of actions take place based on the result.  One example would be to have a condition execute only if a condition is true.**

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```ruby
if
elsif
else  
end
```

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
**To add multiple conditions to an if statement, you would use elsif.**

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
```ruby
if speed > 85 && speed_limit <= 45
  puts "I'm going to jail!"
  wealth -=10000
elsif speed > 85 && speed_limit <= 65
  puts "I'll pay the ticket"
  wealth -=100
else
  puts "I'm enjoying the ride!"
end
```
