## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

    **Asking questions is something I have historically struggled with.  My tendency is to try and push through and solve problems on my own without asking for help.  I typically wait too long because I enjoy the satisfaction of figuring it out on my own.**

    **I will need to ensure I follow the 20-30 minute rule whereby if I can't figure something out on my own in that time length, I reach out for assistance.**

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
    ```ruby
    puts '"Hello World!"'
    ```

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
    **Comments are indicated with '#''**

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
      **Float contains decimal points such as 20.3 where as integers do not contain decimal points.**

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
```ruby
animal = "zebra"
```
6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
```ruby
    puts animal
```
7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
    **Interpolation is when a variable is substituted into a string.**

    **Example:**
    ```ruby
    puts "The #{animal} ran away very quickly.```

8. What method is used to get input from a user?
  ```ruby
  gets.chomp
  ```

9. Name and describe two common string methods:
    **str.upcase converts each character of a string to uppercase
    str.reverse will reverse a string**
