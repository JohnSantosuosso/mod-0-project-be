#Take a look at how you used (0..5) in the last for-loop. Look up Ruby's "range operator" (.. and ...) online to see what it does.
#Ruby ranges provide a set of values that start and end with the specified information inside the parentheses (0..5).  Any appropriate method performed on the range will be done for each element in range.

#Change the first for number in the_count to be a more typical .each style loop like the others.

#Find the Ruby documentation on arrays and read about them. What other operations can you do besides the push function? Try <<, which is the same as push but is an operator. fruits << x is the same as fruits.push(x).
#Other operations that arrays can perform include .pop (remove last element), shift(remove first element and returns it), and unshift(adds first element of array and returns array).
